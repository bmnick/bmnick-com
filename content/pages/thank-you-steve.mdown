Summary: A poor tribute to a great man

#Thank You Steve

I hate that I have to write this.  Some part of me knew it was coming, but I still wish it didn't need to be so soon.  Steve was an inspiration for me.  I was a late convert to Apple, but after discovering what Apple products were really like I switched completely.  Steve was a big part of making those wonderful things.

I wish I could say something more meaningful, but I'm not exactly a word smith.  Steve Jobs was a visionary, and we will miss him.

And now, I need to go do my best to make something beautiful.  I can think of no better tribute.
